Merge MSB/LSB into 16-bit composite entities

- Auto-detect *_msb/_lsb channel pairs and create a single 16-bit Light entity
- Map 0..255 brightness to 0..65535 DMX value and write MSB+LSB channels
- Keep unique ids stable; humanize display names

All tests pass.
Format display names: humanize fixture and channel names

- Convert underscore_separated names to Title Case with spaces
- Keep unique_ids unchanged
- Mark autoplay channels hidden by default in fixture mapping

Run tests and updated tests to be robust to casing.
